# Overview - Garage Door via MQTT
This is a repo with some script's that I have in my Shellies. 
The discovery.js script is what I currently use on my Dumb Garage Door. It will operate as a cover in Homeassistant. It is set up 
with a reed switch in the `open` posistion. It will also report the status of the door every two minutes.
